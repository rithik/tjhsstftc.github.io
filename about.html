Hey! My name is Sidharth Rampally, and I am a sophomore at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology. My FIRST journey started back in 2008, and later 2012, my former team transitioned into FTC. Between that time, we went to the International Championships, and had a blast in FLL. This year, I am so excited for what comes ahead with my new team! I enjoy flying drones and playing soccer, and this year in FTC, I hope to CAD and 3D print vital parts for the robot. I also wish to apply my knowledge of Java to the real-world.

Hello! My name is Rithik Yelisetty, and I am a sophomore at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology. I have been competing in robotics competitions since 2011, when I was first a part of a FIRST Lego League team. It was a great experience, and I have loved robotics ever since. This year, I am extending my knowledge about robotics by taking a course at our school that teaches students about real world robots. As part of this year’s FTC challenge, I hope to improve my CAD skills, and my Android programming skills. Some of my hobbies include playing soccer.

My name is Rahul Rajan, and I am a sophomore at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology. I have taken part in STEM competitions such as FIRST Lego League and TSA since I was in 5th grade. FLL enhanced my problem solving and collaboration skills. However, most importantly, it got me interested in robotics and STEM in general. This will be my first year doing FTC and I hope to use the skills I gained from FIRST and other competitions to help fabricate a successful robot and spread my passion for STEM to my community.

Hi! My name is Arko Bhattacharyya, but my friends call me Alex. I am currently a sophomore at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology. I started robotics in 2010. I have lots of experience with First Lego League, many of which I shared with Rithik who was also on that team. This year I plan to apply new building skills I have gained from school and also gain new skills directly from FTC. My main focus is building but I also enjoy other aspects of FTC. I can’t wait to show FTC what the __(insert team name here)___ are capable of completing.

Hey y’all! My name is Sricharan Bachu, but my friends call me Charan. I am currently a sophomore at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology. I competed in FIRST Lego League for one year, mentored my brothers team for two years. In my free time I play FIFA on the PS3 and play soccer with my friends. This year, in FTC, I would like to further my knowledge of robots gained through completing in FLL. I would also like to apply my programming skills that I have learned in school.

Hi, my name is Kanvi Shah and I am a sophomore at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology. I started my FIRST journey in 2010 with three consecutive exciting seasons of FIRST Lego League. Since then, I have pursued STEM subjects, in and outside of school. I am also a member of our school’s theatre program, as an actress and backstage crew member. Hobbies of mine include dancing and playing piano. This year in FTC, I’m looking to learn about the application of the engineering process and further my interests in robotics.

Hi! My name is Tanvi Haldankar, and I am currently a sophomore at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology. This is my first year doing any robotics challenge and I can’t wait to see what we can accomplish. I absolutely love anything to do with computer science and applications of it in the real world. Some of my hobbies include playing piano, playing soccer, and being a Girl Scout! This year, in FTC, I hope to get more experience with building parts of the robot and applying what I currently know about computer science!

Hello! My name is Shwetark Patel, and I am a sophomore at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology. This is my first year doing anything with FIRST, and I’m very excited to get started. I’ve been programming for seven years using a variety of programming languages, and have had a lot of fun developing open source apps, competing in hackathons, and developing websites. Last year, I made the USACO camp after placing well in the monthly USACO contests. I’m very excited to apply my programming skills to real world robotics challenges through FTC.
